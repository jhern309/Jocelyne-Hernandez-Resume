        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello, my name is Jocelyne Hernandez and I graduated from the University of California, Riverside. I have received my masters and postgraduate certificate in marketing from this university. My experience in working as an office assistant, working for elections and being a member of the organization have helped me in the media planner section of my marketing. I hosted many conferences, meetings and help make sure everything is going according to plan. My communication skills have allowed me to expand my marketing to other parts of the world since I speak Spanish and English fluently. This is rather helpful since I have been able to communicate to people what I am marketing more easier in one language than another. In working in an office setting, most of my marketing experience stems from there. I was an office assistant for a long time, I worked my way up from being a teaching assistant. I helped organize papers, hand out important documents, answer phone calls, and navigate people to the correct area they were visiting. This experience allowed me to make connections with people I see everyday in the office, those who visit regularly, and the employers. These connections allowed me to get a foot in the door when I started my internships throughout college. My past employers assisted me in communicating me with people they thought could help me to advance in my career. I ended up marketing for the building I was an office assistant for a couple of years but then moved on to newer things. I am forever grateful for what my employers did for me and I remind them every chance I get. Whenever the business side of marketing gets confusing or I am stumb, I give them a call for their input. That is the thing with who I am, the one thing I want everyone to know about me: I will always need the help everyone, I will never step over or shut down anyone else's ideas. I never want to be that person in which I take credit for getting myself where I am today when in reality I have had help. Everyone deserves recognition and respect in any area of work. In the marketing business, I have also learned that people will not take one seriously if one does not assert some sort of dominance, those that work around them or for them will take advantage of the person. I have found myself in doing marketing, I use to be a timid, young lady that was afraid of speaking her mind but now I am a confident woman who lets her voice be heard. I have seen people assume their own thoughts about me even before we have spoken, itâ€™s always with great pride that I get to knock down those thoughts. Although I do have a carefree side, I never want people to assume that they can just get away with not pulling their own weight. Just as I hold myself accountable for the work, I also hold my team to the same standard..<br><br>
